# ZMS_REPOSITORY

## What is it

SharePoint has a great advantage for storing Word, PowerPoint and other documents, multi-person collaboration, etc. SAP Audit Management by default stores working paper in HANA DB.Â  This was an architecture decision to take advantage of full-text-index of HANA, so that unstructured files can be searched from enterprise search. But many of our customers still want to store them on SharePoint. With the abstract layer of file repository, this GitHub repository implements the existing programming interface to help you switch your file storage from HANA DB to SharePoint.
